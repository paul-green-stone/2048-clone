## Getting Started with Animation Contributions

To implement animation of sliding puzzles:
- Review the existing game and framework source code, focusing on how tile movements are handled.
- You may want to leverage SDL2 capabilities for smooth animations.
- Consider performance and cross-platform compatibility (note: testing is currently only on Linux/Unix).
- Share your approach in an issue before starting to get feedback and avoid redundant work.
